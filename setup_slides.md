## Workshop structure
 - First theory then exercises
 - Overview of exercised commands will be visible during exercise
 - If stuck or don't understand the TODO ask immediately, we're here to help
 - If you start feeling that solution to a given problem is too complicated you might be doing something wrong, ask for help/clarification
 - Exercises are structured in dedicated packages
 - Every exercise is unit-tested and failing assertions are going to try to keep you informed about what's the possible problem with your solution
